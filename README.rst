Flask-Kerberos
==============

Flask-Kerberos is an extension to `Flask`_ that allows you to trivially add
`Kerberos`_ based authentication to your website. It depends on both Flask and
`python-kerberos`_ 1.1.1+. You can install the requirements from PyPI with
`easy_install` or `pip` or download them by hand.

Unfortunately, as is the case with most things kerberos, it requires a kerberos
environment as well as a keytab. Setting that up is outside the scope of this
document.

The official copy of this documentation is available at `Read the Docs`_.

Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Flask-Kerberos

or alternatively if you have `pip` installed::

    $ pip install Flask-Kerberos

How to Use
----------

To integrate Flask-Kerberos into your application you'll need to generate your
keytab set the environment variable `KRB5_KTNAME` in your shell to the location
of the keytab file.

After that, it should be as easy as decorating any view functions you wish to
require authentication, and changing them to accept the authenticated user
principal as their first argument::

    from flask_kerberos import requires_authentication

    @app.route("/protected")
    @requires_authentication
    def protected_view(user):
        ...


Flask-Kerberos assumes that the service will be running using the hostname of
the host on which the application is run. If this is not the case, you can
override it by initializing the module::

    from flask_kerberos import init_kerberos

    init_kerberos(app, hostname='example.com')


How it works
------------

When a protected view is accessed by a client, it will check to see if the
request includes authentication credentials in an `Authorization` header. If
there are no such credentials, the application will respond immediately with a
`401 Unauthorized` response which includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field
with a value of `Negotiate` indicating to the client that they are currently
unauthorized, but that they can authenticate using Negotiate authentication.

If credentials are presented in the `Authorization` header, the credentials will
be validated, the principal of the authenticating user will be extracted, and
the protected view will be called with the extracted principal passed in as the
first argument.

Once the protected view returns, a `WWW-Authenticate` header will be added to
the response which can then be used by the client to authenticate the server.
This is known as mutual authentication.

Full Example
------------

To see a simple example, you can download the code `from github
